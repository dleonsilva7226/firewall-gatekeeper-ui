## üìñ How It Works

### 1. File Upload & Analysis

The platform supports multiple file types for security analysis:

#### Supported File Types
- **Text Files**: `.txt`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.md`, `.log`
- **Image Files**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`, `.svg`

#### Upload Methods
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag files onto the upload area
- **File Browser**: Click "Choose File" to browse your system
- **Demo Mode**: Load a pre-configured demo file with sample threats

### 2. Security Analysis Process

When a file is uploaded, the system performs comprehensive analysis:

1. **File Type Detection**: Identifies the file format and applies appropriate analysis methods
2. **Content Scanning**: Analyzes file contents for suspicious patterns
3. **Threat Classification**: Categorizes detected threats by severity and type
4. **Pattern Highlighting**: Marks suspicious content with interactive tooltips
5. **Result Generation**: Creates detailed analysis report with recommendations

### 3. Threat Detection Capabilities

#### Prompt Injection Detection
- Identifies attempts to override system instructions
- Detects malicious prompt manipulation techniques
- Flags suspicious command injections

#### Sensitive Information Exposure
- Detects leaked credentials and passwords
- Identifies exposed API tokens and secrets
- Flags confidential data in unexpected contexts

#### Jailbreaking Attempts
- Recognizes attempts to bypass safety restrictions
- Detects system prompt extraction attempts
- Identifies unauthorized access requests

### 4. User Interface Components

### Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User uploads file via drag-drop or file browser
2. **Processing**: File is analyzed based on type (text/image)
3. **Analysis**: Content is scanned for threats and suspicious patterns
4. **Storage**: Results are stored in application state
5. **Display**: Analysis results are rendered in the UI
6. **History**: All analyses are maintained in the history view

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=30000

# Security Settings
VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
VITE_ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=.txt,.json,.csv,.md,.log,.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.gif,.bmp,.webp,.svg

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=true

## üìù API Integration

### Backend Integration
The frontend is designed to integrate with a backend API for actual threat detection:

```typescript
// Example API integration
const analyzeFile = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### Expected API Endpoints
- `POST /api/analyze` - File analysis endpoint
- `GET /api/history` - Analysis history retrieval
- `GET /api/stats` - Statistics and metrics
- `POST /api/feedback` - User feedback submission

## üîí Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- Input validation for all file uploads
- File type verification and size limits
- XSS protection through proper content sanitization
- CSRF protection for API calls

### Data Privacy
- No sensitive data stored in browser storage
- Secure handling of file contents
- Proper cleanup of temporary data
- User consent for data processing

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Optimization Strategies
- Lazy loading of analysis results
- Image compression and optimization
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
- Debounced search and filtering
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error boundary implementation
- User interaction analytics
- Resource usage monitoring

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### File Upload Issues
- **Problem**: Files not uploading
- **Solution**: Check file size limits and supported formats

#### Image Display Problems
- **Problem**: Images not showing
- **Solution**: Verify image format support and file integrity

#### Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Slow analysis or rendering
- **Solution**: Check file size limits and browser performance

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by setting `VITE_DEBUG=true` in your environment variables.
